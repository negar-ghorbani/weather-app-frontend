## General Information
- For autocomplete locations and weather forecast information, two external APIs were used. The Geoapify API offered location autocomplete, and Open-Meteo was used for the Weather Forecast API.

- Following the selection of a place, information such as the date, time, location temperature, wind direction, wind speed, weather code, and weather icon will be displayed.

- The weather symbol will change dependent on the weather code, allowing the user to receive real-time information on the weather situation.

- To alter the temperature unit, the user may toggle the unit button between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
